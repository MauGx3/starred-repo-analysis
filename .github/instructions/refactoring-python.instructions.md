# Refactoring Python Code

## Overview

* Before refactoring anything, ensure you have a comprehensive suite of tests to verify that functionality remains unchanged.
* Only automatically refactor code that doesn't follow the Pythonic conventions, specially those outlined in the Python instructions at `.github/instructions/python.instructions.md` if that file is available.
* Use automated tools like `ruff` to identify and fix style issues before refactoring.

## Performance

* Follow the performance guidelines at `.github/instructions/performance-python.instructions.md` if that file is available.
